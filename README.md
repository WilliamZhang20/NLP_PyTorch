# NLP_PyTorch

Following the NLP from Scratch [guide](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/nlp_from_scratch_index.html) by PyTorch.
3 Projects are involved:
1. Classify names into language of origin
2. Generate names from languages
3. Translate text from French to English

For the first project, I used my CPU to train, which was quite slow. So for the other two, I'll use Jupyter Notebook on the Google Colab GPU.
